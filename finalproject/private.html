            <p>Private walks are wonderful for younger dogs that are still more interested in playing than walking in a small group, elderly dogs that need to take it nice and slow, or dogs working on overcoming fear aggression issues. When handling your pupâ€™s private walks we will be more than happy to feed your pup and help reinforce any training you and your pup might be working on.</p>
